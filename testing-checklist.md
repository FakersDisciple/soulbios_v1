# ðŸ§ª SoulBios V1 - Final Testing Checklist

## **Day 5: End-to-End Integration Testing**

### **âœ… Health & Authentication Tests**
```bash
# 1. Health Check (No auth required)
curl https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/health

# Expected: 200 OK with performance metrics

# 2. Unauthorized Access Test
curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test", "message": "Hello"}'

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

### **âœ… Authenticated API Tests**
```bash
# 3. Chat Endpoint Test (With Auth)
curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test_user", "message": "Tell me about personal growth"}'

# Expected: 200 OK with multi-agent response in <800ms

# 4. Chamber Creation Test
curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chamber/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
  -H "X-User-ID: test_user" \
  -d '{"session_type": "growth", "duration": 30}'

# Expected: 200 OK with session ID
```

### **âœ… Rate Limiting Tests**
```bash
# 5. Rate Limit Test (Run 51+ requests rapidly)
for i in {1..55}; do
  curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"user_id": "rate_test", "message": "Test '$i'"}'
  echo "Request $i completed"
done

# Expected: First 50 succeed, then 429 Rate Limit Exceeded
```

## **Day 6: Performance & Load Testing**

### **âœ… Response Time Validation**
```bash
# 6. Performance Test (Measure response times)
time curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "perf_test", "message": "Complex philosophical question about consciousness and growth"}'

# Expected: Response time <1.5 seconds, ideally <800ms
```

### **âœ… Load Testing Script**
```bash
# 7. Concurrent Load Test
# Create load-test-production.ps1:
```

### **âœ… Memory & Resource Monitoring**
```bash
# 8. Monitor Cloud Run Metrics
gcloud run services describe [SERVICE-NAME] \
  --region=[YOUR-REGION] \
  --format="table(status.conditions[].type:label=CONDITION,status.conditions[].status:label=STATUS)"

# Check logs for errors:
gcloud logs read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision" --limit=50
```

## **Day 7: User Acceptance & Final Validation**

### **âœ… Agent Response Quality**
```bash
# 9. Multi-Agent Response Test
curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "quality_test", 
    "message": "I want to understand my purpose in life and develop better habits"
  }'

# Verify response contains:
# âœ… Teacher agent: Socratic questions
# âœ… Narrative agent: Story/metaphor
# âœ… Transcendent agent: Philosophical insights  
# âœ… Context agent: Historical reference
```

### **âœ… Chamber Functionality**
```bash
# 10. Complete Chamber Flow Test
# a) Create session
SESSION_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chamber/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]" \
  -H "X-User-ID: chamber_test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_type": "consciousness", "duration": 15}')

# b) Extract session ID
SESSION_ID=$(echo $SESSION_RESPONSE | jq -r '.session_id')

# c) Check session status  
curl https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chamber/$SESSION_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-SOULBIOS-API-KEY]"

# Expected: Active session with growth prompts
```

### **âœ… Security Validation**
```bash
# 11. Security Headers Test
curl -I https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/health

# Verify security headers are present
# Expected headers: CORS, Content-Type, etc.

# 12. Invalid API Key Test
curl -X POST https://[YOUR-SERVICE-URL]/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-key-12345" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "security_test", "message": "Test"}'

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```
