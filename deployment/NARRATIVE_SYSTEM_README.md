}

// Individual story nodes
class NarrativeNode {
  final String id;
  final NarrativeNodeType type;
  final String content;

  final int progressScore;
}
```

- Alice state provider updates for contextual awareness

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Character Selection
- User selects character in chamber
- System checks for narrative support
- Launches narrative dialogue or shows fallback message

### 2. Narrative Progression
- Character presents opening dialogue
- User makes choices that reflect their emotional state
- System tracks progress and visited nodes
- Character provides insights based on user's path

### 3. Completion & Integration
- Narrative concludes with character-specific wisdom
- Progress points awarded based on engagement
- Alice consciousness system updated with narrative data
- Chamber progress enhanced by narrative completion

## Content Quality Standards

### Dialogue Requirements
- Minimum 30 characters for dialogue nodes
- Character-appropriate language patterns
- Emotional resonance and authenticity
- Clear progression toward insights

### Character Voice Consistency
- **Compassionate Friend**: "I can sense...", "You're not alone...", "Let's sit with this..."
- **Resilient Explorer**: "What if we tried...", "You're stronger than you realize...", "This is your growth edge..."
- **Wise Detective**: "I'm noticing a pattern...", "What's really going on...", "Let's investigate..."

### Branching Logic
- Minimum 2-3 meaningful choices per decision point
- Each path leads to character-appropriate insights
- Progressive complexity based on user engagement
- Clear completion criteria and rewards

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Narrative

    selectedCharacter = character;
    showingNarrative = true;
  });
}
```

### Processing User Choices
```dart
// In narrative widget
void _handleChoiceSelected(NarrativeChoice choice) async {
  final newState = await NarrativeService().processChoice(
    narrative,
    currentState,
    choice.id,
  );
  
  setState(() {
    currentState = newState;
  });
}
```

### Completion Handling
```dart
void _onNarrativeComplete(NarrativeState finalState) {
  // Award progress points
  final progressBonus = (finalState.progressScore / 100).clamp(0.0, 1.0);
  
  // Update Alice consciousness system
  ref.read(aliceStateProvider.notifier).updateChamberProgress(
    chamber: chamberId,
    completionPercentage: progressBonus,
    activityType: 'narrative_completed',
  );
}
```
